# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains resources for protein secondary structure prediction using fully connected neural networks (FCNN). It includes data, a pretrained model, and notebooks for data handling, model creation, and training.

## Data
All data, including training and testing sets for cross-validation and blind testing, can be found in the 'data' folder.

## Pretrained Model
A pretrained FCNN model is available in the repository.

## Notebooks
- To use the pretrained model for prediction, refer to the notebook 'Prediction_Nb_LL' and run it in Google Colab.
- For access to the code used for data handling, model creation, and training, refer to the notebook 'Project_Notebook' located in the 'notebooks' folder.
